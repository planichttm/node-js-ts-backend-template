# Repositories Layer

Repositories serve as the data access layer, providing a clean abstraction over database operations while completely isolating database implementation details from the rest of your application. They handle all CRUD operations through a carefully designed interface split between read-only (public) and write (sync) concerns, creating a clear separation of responsibilities that improves maintainability. Repository implementations encapsulate data validation, error handling, transaction management, and data transformation logic, effectively turning database records into domain objects and vice versa, without exposing the underlying data storage mechanisms to higher application layers.

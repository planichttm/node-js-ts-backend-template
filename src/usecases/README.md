# UseCases Layer

UseCases encapsulate core business logic and domain rules, serving as the essential coordination layer that connects API controllers with data repositories without being tied to either HTTP or database specifics. They handle the transformation, validation, and orchestration of data flows, implementing the actual intelligence of your application by determining how data should be processed, combined, and returned. Unlike controllers (which manage HTTP interactions), repositories (which handle data persistence), or sync services (which manage scheduled data synchronization), UseCases represent the actual business behaviors and use-cases your application supports, making them the ideal place to implement domain-specific rules and transformations independent of infrastructure concerns.
